# Deni-Password-Generator

Per this assignment, I was instructed to modify and create javascript code to generate a safe password for employees through a specified webpage. 

To so so, I was given starter code to which I had to modify and add additional functions to provide results within the parameters specified which were to be:

1. a randomly generated password
2. between 8 and 128 characters in length
3. option to include upper case characters
4. option to include lower case characters
5. option to include special characters

Upon the generate password button click, the employee is able to answer a series of prompts starting with the desired character length, followed by whether they wish to include the other character types. Once answering these prompts, a random password is displayed on the HTML page which the employee can then copy and paste for use, OR they can click the "Generate Password" button again to produce a new result.
